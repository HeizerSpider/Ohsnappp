# Project Description
<br> <b>Problem Statement:</b> Improving cohort based learning through a fully integrated photo application to capture vital information on the whiteboard or screen. 
<br> <b>Main Idea:</b> Establish an automated camera system that will be able to capture vital lesson contents. Students can send instruction to take pictures through a Telegram bot whilst teachers and admins can use the kivy app to adjust camera position. The Kivy app has a log in interface to prevent misuse by students.

Project Components:
- <b>Telegram Chatbot</b>: Coded with python
- <b>RPi</b>: To act as server for chatbot as well as hardware control
- <b>PiCam</b>: Image capture
- <b>Servo motor</b>: Camera angle adjustment
- <b>Kivy</b>: For admin user control of camera angle

Work Progress Test: Device mounted on ceiling and image captured using telegram chatbot
